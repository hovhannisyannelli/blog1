I, Nelli Hovhannisyan, am a current Data Science student with a strong passion for exploring human behavior and mental health through data-driven insights. My goal is to leverage analytical tools to uncover patterns and develop solutions that enhance mental well-being and access to care. With a background in analyzing complex datasets, I am committed to bridging the gap between technology and human-centered approaches.
